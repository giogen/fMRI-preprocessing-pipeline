# fMRI-preprocessing-pipeline

This repository will be updated with scripts used to analyze functional brain imaging data at the California Institute of Technology by Giovanni Gentile and co-authors.

Scripts will be a collection of shell scripts and corresponding Python-based pipelines generated with http://nipy.org/nipype/0.10.0/.

More info will follow as the collection of scripts for a number of different projects grows.
